# AI Code Review Analysis: Executive Summary

## The Test Idea
I've wondered which model is best to review and existing codebase to highlight gaps and help im prove it. I gave the same codenase for an API codebase I'm using and the same prompt for a code review to GPT 5 Mini, Sonnet 4, Opus 4, and Grok 4.

## Key Finding
**The lower cost model finds critical issues. The higher cost model misses them.**

## Quick Comparison from each run

| Model | Cost | Critical Issues Found | Business Risk |
|-------|------|----------------------|---------------|
| **GPT-5 Mini** | $0.15 | 9 specific problems | ✅ Catches real risks |
| **Sonnet 4** | $2.94 | 3 cosmetic issues | ⚠️ **FALSE CONFIDENCE** |
| **Opus 4** | $6.59 | 12 deep issues | ✅ Thorough but expensive |
| **Grok 4** | $8.80 | 5 vague observations | ❌ Not a lot of value |

## The Critical Problem

**Sonnet 4 DANGEROUSLY rated the codebase as "EXCELLENT" (95/100) when:**
- No test files actually existed (rated testing 5/5)
- Security vulnerabilities were present (rated security 5/5)  
- Race conditions existed in production code (rated 5/5)

**This false positive could lead to:**
- Production failures
- Security breaches
- Compliance violations

## What GPT-5 Mini ($0.15) Found That Sonnet 4 ($2.94) Missed

1. **Race condition** in rate limiter → System crashes under load
2. **XSS vulnerability** in security headers → Data breaches
3. **No CI/CD enforcement** → Broken code in production
4. **Cache configuration errors** → Performance failures
5. **Database SSL misconfiguration** → Security exposure

## Cost Reality Check

### 1000 Reviews
- **Current approach** (if using Sonnet 4): $2,940/year, misses critical issues
- **Recommended approach** (GPT-5 Mini): $150/year, finds real problems
- **Savings**: 95% lower
- **Risk reduction**: 3x more issues caught

## Action Items

### Immediate
1. **Switch to GPT-5 Mini** for all code reviews
2. **Stop using Sonnet 4** - it creates false confidence
3. **Audit past reviews** - recheck any code approved by Sonnet 4

### For Critical Systems Only
- Add Opus 4 as secondary validation for M&A or compliance audits, but increases cost over 40x
- Still start with GPT-5 Mini first

## The Bottom Line

**You're buying problem detection.**

- GPT-5 Mini: Finds problems that break systems
- Sonnet 4: Makes everything look good (dangerous)
- **Decision**: Use the cost effective option that actually works

## ROI Summary

**By switching to GPT-5 Mini:**
- **Save**: 95% on review costs
- **Gain**: 3x more critical issue detection
- **Avoid**: Production failures from missed problems
